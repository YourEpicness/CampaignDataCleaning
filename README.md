# Campaign Data Cleaning
A takehome assessment that demonstrates uses of python pandas library to clean data

## Situation
Our client has requested us to contact a list of voters with phone calls, and ask a single question: Can
we count on you to vote for life by voting for these pro-life candidates?

The CHQ Client Success Team has arranged for several call centers to complete these phone calls, and you are tasked with providing a data return and report to the client.
## The Data

The file “Sample Call Data.csv” contains the raw dialer output from several call centers combined. The specific dialing and script infrastructure used to make the phone calls varies between call centers and thus data is returned in varying formats, so the output data needs translation and cleaning before
returning it to our client.
